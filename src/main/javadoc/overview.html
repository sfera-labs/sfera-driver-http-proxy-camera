		Driver for the integration of IP cameras with MJPG video stream.
		<p>
		The driver creates a proxy to make the video stream from the camera available on Sfera's HTTP(S) server at the path /camera/&lt;driver_instance_id&gt;.<br />
		Support for HTTP basic access authentication is provided.
		<p>
		This driver can be used to show the video stream of a camera on a Web interface provided by the Web App.<br />
		To this end, use an image component and set the source attribute to the camera's path.<br />
		For instance, assuming the camera driver has ID "my_cam":
		<p>
		<code>
		    &lt;image height="200" width="300" source="camera/my_cam" x="10" y="10" /&gt;
		</code>
